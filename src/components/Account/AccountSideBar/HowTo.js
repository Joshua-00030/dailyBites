                  To begin, lets start by looking at the Home Page.
                  Here, the Home page provides users with a variety of different widgets that offer
                  unique functionality to the user!  This includes viewing calorie consumption data, 
                  calculating one's daily estimated calorie limit, and tracking their weight goals.  
                  The widgets are defined below:

                  Users can then select the date range to view all food items that they have consumed 
                  throughout that time and how they have contributed towards their caloric intake.
                  </label>
